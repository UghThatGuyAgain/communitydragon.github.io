# Introduction
## Background
The company "Riot Games" owns and develops a game called "League of Legends". Riot Games provides a public API and CDN for this game. The static data provided by the API and the CDN are named as "Data Dragon". the problem arises when Data Dragon does not fix the issues within the static data and lacks assets that third party developers would like to use. This community under the name "Community Dragon" has been founded with the goal to tackle the issues that Data Dragon provides. 

## Goals
The goals for this project are simple:
* Create an API and CDN to give developers an alternative to data dragon.
  * This API and CDN will manage the inconsistent and not updated data provided by Data Dragon.
  * This API and CDN  will provide extended and aditional data that Data dragon currently does not provide.
